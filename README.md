# Finnish-Refugee-Council
In collaboration with 180 Degrees Consulting Helsinki, I worked with a team of four to come up with a strategy for the Finnish Refugee Council (FRC) for enlarging their student donor base. The first stage of the project entailed writing and conducting a survey of local students on their attitudes towards donating to NGOs and their familiarity and favorability of FRC. The survey was open between 27.03.2020 and 21.04.2020 and was targeted and distributed (nonrandomly) to students of Finnish universities.
